<h2>📄 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Digi Potato</strong> is a machine learning project designed to identify the health status of potato plants by analyzing images of the crop. It classifies potato plants as <strong>Early Blight</strong>, <strong>Late Blight</strong>, or <strong>Healthy</strong> using a deep learning model trained on a dataset of plant images.
</p>

<h2>⚙️ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trained with TensorFlow to achieve high accuracy in plant disease classification.</li>
  <li>Capable of distinguishing between Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy potato plants.</li>
  <li>Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based disease detection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🖼️ Dataset</h2>
<p>
  The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of potato leaves affected by early blight, late blight, and healthy leaves. Each image is preprocessed and fed into the model to ensure accuracy in disease prediction.
</p>

<h2>📂 Files Included</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>model_architecture.json</code>: The architecture of the trained model.</li>
  <li><code>model_weights.weights.h5</code>: The weights of the trained model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Upload an image of a potato plant leaf.</li>
  <li>The trained model analyzes the image to detect if the leaf shows signs of early blight, late blight, or is healthy.</li>
  <li>The result is returned, helping farmers and researchers monitor the health of their crops.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🔧 Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>TensorFlow</li>
</ul>
