Digi Potato
Digi Potato is an innovative AI-powered model designed for efficient processing and tracking of video footage using TensorFlow and JAX. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize, track, and analyze objects or individuals in real-time video streams, assigning unique identifiers and recording details like entry and exit times. This robust system enables consistent object re-identification and tracks durations with precision. The model is built with TensorFlow's advanced capabilities, and it supports exporting trained models for further deployment and analysis.

Key Features:
Object Tracking: Assigns unique IDs to objects or people in the video, tracks their movement, and logs their presence with timestamps.
Real-Time Analytics: Records detailed entry and exit times of tracked objects or individuals.
Model Export: Supports model architecture and weight saving for further deployment.
Video Processing: Efficiently processes video streams using TensorFlow and JAX frameworks.
Project Structure:
Model Architecture: Custom TensorFlow model with dense layers for video data processing.
Weights Export: Saves model architecture in JSON and weights in .h5 format.
Tracking Algorithm: Implements advanced object tracking for real-time applications.
